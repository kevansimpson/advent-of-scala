  *  * <h2>Part 1</h2>
  * You're starting to sweat as the ship makes its way toward Mercury. The Elves suggest that you get the air conditioner
  * working by upgrading your ship computer to support the Thermal Environment Supervision Terminal.
  *
  * The Thermal Environment Supervision Terminal (TEST) starts by running a diagnostic program (your puzzle input). The
  * TEST diagnostic program will run on your existing Intcode computer after a few modifications:
  *
  * First, you'll need to add two new instructions:
  * <ul>
  *      <li>Opcode 3 takes a single integer as input and saves it to the position given by its only parameter.
  *          For example, the instruction 3,50 would take an input value and store it at address 50.</li>
  *      <li>Opcode 4 outputs the value of its only parameter. For example, the instruction 4,50 would output
  *          the value at address 50.</li>
  * </ul>
  * Programs that use these instructions will come with documentation that explains what should be connected to the
  * input and output. The program 3,0,4,0,99 outputs whatever it gets as input, then halts.
  *
  * Second, you'll need to add support for parameter modes:
  *
  * Each parameter of an instruction is handled based on its parameter mode. Right now, your ship computer already
  * understands parameter mode 0, position mode, which causes the parameter to be interpreted as a position - if the
  * parameter is 50, its value is the value stored at address 50 in memory. Until now, all parameters have been in
  * position mode.
  *
  * Now, your ship computer will also need to handle parameters in mode 1, immediate mode. In immediate mode, a
  * parameter is interpreted as a value - if the parameter is 50, its value is simply 50.
  *
  * Parameter modes are stored in the same value as the instruction's opcode. The opcode is a two-digit number based
  * only on the ones and tens digit of the value, that is, the opcode is the rightmost two digits of the first value
  * in an instruction. Parameter modes are single digits, one per parameter, read right-to-left from the opcode: the
  * first parameter's mode is in the hundreds digit, the second parameter's mode is in the thousands digit, the third
  * parameter's mode is in the ten-thousands digit, and so on. Any missing modes are 0.
  *
  * For example, consider the program 1002,4,3,4,33.
  *
  * The first instruction, 1002,4,3,4, is a multiply instruction - the rightmost two digits of the first value, 02,
  * indicate opcode 2, multiplication. Then, going right to left, the parameter modes are 0 (hundreds digit),
  * 1 (thousands digit), and 0 (ten-thousands digit, not present and therefore zero):
  * <pre>
  * ABCDE
  *  1002
  *
  * DE - two-digit opcode,      02 == opcode 2
  *  C - mode of 1st parameter,  0 == position mode
  *  B - mode of 2nd parameter,  1 == immediate mode
  *  A - mode of 3rd parameter,  0 == position mode,
  *                                   omitted due to being a leading zero
  * </pre>
  *
  * This instruction multiplies its first two parameters. The first parameter, 4 in position mode, works like it did
  * before - its value is the value stored at address 4 (33). The second parameter, 3 in immediate mode, simply has
  * value 3. The result of this operation, 33 * 3 = 99, is written according to the third parameter, 4 in position mode,
  * which also works like it did before - 99 is written to address 4.
  *
  * Parameters that an instruction writes to will never be in immediate mode.
  *
  * Finally, some notes:
  * <ul>
  *     <li>It is important to remember that the instruction pointer should increase by the number of values in the
  *          instruction after the instruction finishes. Because of the new instructions, this amount is no longer always 4.</li>
  *     <li>Integers can be negative: 1101,100,-1,4,0 is a valid program (find 100 + -1, store the result in position 4).</li>
  * </ul>
  *
  * The TEST diagnostic program will start by requesting from the user the ID of the system to test by running an input
  * instruction - provide it 1, the ID for the ship's air conditioner unit.
  *
  * It will then perform a series of diagnostic tests confirming that various parts of the Intcode computer, like
  * parameter modes, function correctly. For each test, it will run an output instruction indicating how far the result
  * of the test was from the expected value, where 0 means the test was successful. Non-zero outputs mean that a function
  * is not working correctly; check the instructions that were run before the output instruction to see which one failed.
  *
  * Finally, the program will output a diagnostic code and immediately halt. This final output isn't an error; an output
  * followed immediately by a halt means the program finished. If all outputs were zero except the diagnostic code, the
  * diagnostic program ran successfully.
  *
  * After providing 1 to the only input instruction and passing all the tests, what diagnostic code does the program produce?
  *
  * <h2>Part 2</h2>
  * The air conditioner comes online! Its cold air feels good for a while, but then the TEST alarms start to go off.
  * Since the air conditioner can't vent its heat anywhere but back into the spacecraft, it's actually making the air
  * inside the ship warmer.
  *
  * Instead, you'll need to use the TEST to extend the thermal radiators. Fortunately, the diagnostic program (your
  * puzzle input) is already equipped for this. Unfortunately, your Intcode computer is not.
  *
  * Your computer is only missing a few opcodes:
  * <ul>
  *      <li>Opcode 5 is jump-if-true: if the first parameter is non-zero, it sets the instruction pointer to the value
  *          from the second parameter. Otherwise, it does nothing.</li>
  *      <li>Opcode 6 is jump-if-false: if the first parameter is zero, it sets the instruction pointer to the value from
  *          the second parameter. Otherwise, it does nothing.</li>
  *      <li>Opcode 7 is less than: if the first parameter is less than the second parameter, it stores 1 in the position
  *          given by the third parameter. Otherwise, it stores 0.</li>
  *      <li>Opcode 8 is equals: if the first parameter is equal to the second parameter, it stores 1 in the position
  *          given by the third parameter. Otherwise, it stores 0.</li>
  * </ul>
  *
  * Like all instructions, these instructions need to support parameter modes as described above.
  *
  * Normally, after an instruction is finished, the instruction pointer increases by the number of values in that
  * instruction. However, if the instruction modifies the instruction pointer, that value is used and the instruction
  * pointer is not automatically increased.
  *
  * This time, when the TEST diagnostic program runs its input instruction to get the ID of the system to test, provide
  * it 5, the ID for the ship's thermal radiator controller. This diagnostic test suite only outputs one number,
  * the diagnostic code.
  *
  * What is the diagnostic code for system ID 5?
